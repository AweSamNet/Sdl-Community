# MT Enhanced Provider

This plugin allows you to retrieve translations from either Microsoft Translator or Google Translate.  

The versions of this plugin that are available [here](https://github.com/AweSamNet/Sdl-Community-Legacy-Support/releases), were expressly created to make this great app once again available to older versions of SDL Trados Studio.

To see the latest changes you can [view all of our releases here](https://github.com/AweSamNet/Sdl-Community-Legacy-Support/releases).

## Install

2. Click the desired release's link ending in `.sdlplugin` to download the plugin.
3. Use the SDL Installer tool to install to your version of SDL Trados Studio (Double clicking the file should do it if that is enabled).
